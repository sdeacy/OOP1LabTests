Rules
---------------

You may use any online resource you like to complete this test. This test is not designed to test your memory of method names or documentation.

This lab test is designed to show your understanding of the course so far, but primarily is focused around you understanding your way around creating classes, methods, syntax, etc. It will also test you have a foundational knowledge of `git`.

While you may use any objective-c / ï£¿ resource you like for information, no usage of messenger programs like GChat, Facebook Chat, AIM, MSN, etc is permitted, any breach of this will result in a mark of 0.

Instructions
---------------

`clone` this repository to your machine.

There are a set of **unit tests** in the file `OOP1LabTestTests/Tests.m`. Instructions for each test are written in plain english inside each `it` block.

You can run the tests by pressing `Cmd + U` on your keyboard, or selecting `Product > Test`. You can see the results of the tests i the 4th and 5th menu in the navigation sidebar in XCode (eg: the far left). `Green == passed. Red == failed.`

Make all the tests pass. Each unit test is worth **equal marks**.

- If you make every test pass, you are guaranteed **80%**.
- The remaining **20%** is awarded for code cleanliness and best practice.
- Attempt marks will be awarded for code you write that does not make a test pass, but is on the *right track*.

You will need to create classes and write methods to make these unit tests pass. The methods must be named as described in the **unit test**. Be sure to note the method **types** (eg: class or instance).

Initially, the unit tests will **not compile** because they depend on classes you must create.

You must submit your solution to GitHub and email me the link to `zac@getdrop.com`. If you cannot do this, you may email your solution to me in a zip file, but a penalty of **10%** will be deducted from your mark.

To do so, you will need to add a new remote to this repository using `git remote add` that represents a GitHub repository you have made for submission of this lab (you can call it whatever you wish, but `OOP1LabTest` may make the most sense), you will then need to add, commit, and push to this remote.
